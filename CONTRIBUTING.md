# UK/Hs_code Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open source project! We appreciate your effort and to ensure that your contributions align with the goals of this project and are integrated smoothly, we ask that you follow these guidelines.

1. **Commit Small, Commit Regularly:** Regular and smaller commits are preferred over large, infrequent commits. This makes the changes easier to review and troubleshoot.

2. **Use Imperative Commands:** Your commit titles should succinctly describe the changes you've made. Prefix your commit titles with imperative commands such as: fix, refactor, add, and remove. This is because you should be able to suffix a commit message to the phrase: "If applied, this code will...".

A good practice is to structure your commit title like this: "[GitHub issue number] Add fields to hs record".

Keep It Brief - You're not writing a monologue, so keep it brief. As a general rule, a commit message should not exceed 50 characters.

3. **Use Draft PRs for Ongoing Work:** If your pull request is not ready for review, please mark it as a draft. This indicates to the team that the changes are still in progress.

4. **Request Reviews Before Merging:** When your pull request is ready, request a review from your team members. Reviews ensure that your changes are validated by others.

5. **Address Review Feedback:** If a reviewer asks for changes or provides feedback, please respond promptly and incorporate necessary changes.

6. **Merge Cautiously:** Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, ensure that it's merging into the correct branch and that it's up-to-date with the latest changes in that branch before merging.
